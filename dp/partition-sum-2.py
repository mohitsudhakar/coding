# Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset
# sums is minimum
# Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it in to two sets
# S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is
# minimum.
# If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1
# has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of
# abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

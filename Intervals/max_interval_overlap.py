Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained.
Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party.

1. Brute force is to find, min and max time and count number of guests for each time
This is O(N*(max-min)) time O(max-min) space

2. Sort start and end, and traverse both in merge fashion
    if start <= end, add to curr, else remove from curr
    keep track of max people
O(NlogN) solution
    curr = number of people in room
